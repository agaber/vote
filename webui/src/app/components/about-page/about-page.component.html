    <h2>Voting</h2>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">Instant-runoff voting</a>
    (or ranked-choice voting or alternate vote) is a way of counting votes in
    single-winner elections. In such elections, voters can choose multiple
    candidates in order of preference. Behind the scenes, the algorithm can
    calculate a winner over multiple rounds if necessary, doing its best to keep
    voter preferences in mind.</p>

    <p>CGP Grey's series of <a href="https://www.cgpgrey.com/politics-in-the-animal-kingdom/">YouTube videos</a>
    do a great job of explaining the problems with traditional
    first-past-the-post elections and how other voting algorithms can yield
    fairer and more democratic results.</p>

    <h2>This App</h2>

    <p>The original intent of this application was to support instant run-off
    elections. Users can create random elections with an arbitrary number of
    choices and let people vote by submitting their ranked preferences and a
    winner can be determined using the instant run-off algorithm.</p>

    <p>Truth be told however, an ulterior motive for creating this app was for me
    (agaber) to experiment with a few technologies. What follows are a few
    highlights of the relevant technologies used to build this app.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Kubernetes
        <p>I am using Kubernetes to manage microservices on the cloud. For now
        the cloud provider I'm currently using is DigitalOcean.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Java with Spring Boot
        <p>So I actually like the Java programming language (I know right?) but
        until now I have never tried Spring so I thought I'd give it a shot. To
        be completely honest, I don't love it because there are quite a few
        things that seem to happen at runtime or hidden behavior that changes
        based on the binaries you import, but I was able to get set up quickly
        and I was able to focus most of my time on writing code instead of
        setting up boilerplate which was very cool.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Mongo DB
        <p>To be honest any old database would've sufficed when I got started but
        MongoDB is very easy to set up and their Atlas platform makes it cheap
        and easy to have something running in the cloud. For now I don't need any
        of the features provided by a relational database and since MongoDB is
        part of the NoSQL family of databases, it can scale to handle large
        volumes of data with high read and write throughput.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Angular + TypeScript
        <p>Angular is a soup to nuts web development framework well suited for
        large projects and enterprise level efforts. It provides developers with
        a lot right out of the box which creates a bit of a learning curve
        initially but it also means we automatically get preprocessors and task
        runners that enable us to use things like SCSS and TypeScript and
        production grade deploy binaries.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What's next?</h2>

    <p>
      I'm not sure. ðŸ™‚ I have a lot of feature ideas and there's quite a bit that
      can be done to productionize this app as well (CI/CD, monitoring, logs analysis).
      My initial <a href="https://github.com/agaber/vote/blob/main/product_requirements.pdf">PRD</a>
      also has a few ideas. Sorry that's all so vague and non-committal but I am
      also more than happy to accept feature requests and pull requests on
      <a href="https://github.com/agaber/vote">GitHub</a>.
